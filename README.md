## Overview

This project uses **HTML** and **CSS** to create a mock YouTube homepage, displaying a range of sample videos with basic interaction features such as hover effects on various buttons and elements. The goal of this project is to mimic the visual layout of YouTubeâ€™s interface and practice building structured web layouts with responsive elements.

The project is divided into three main sections:

1. **Navigation Bar**: Fixed at the top, contains the logo, search bar, microphone, and user profile icons.
2. **Sidebar**: Contains buttons like "Home," "Explore," "Subscriptions," and others.
3. **Video Grid**: Displays a grid of video thumbnails with details like the title, channel name, views, and upload date.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Uses CSS flexbox and grid to create a layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Navigation Bar**: Contains icons for search, upload, apps, notifications, and user profile.
- **Sidebar**: Vertical list of buttons that provide navigation options.
- **Video Grid**: Displays videos in a grid format, including thumbnails, titles, and other video information.
